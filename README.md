# Movii

Movii is a Movie searching website. The site allows users to view popular movies with high ratings, upcoming movies that will be released at ta later date, and also look for any existing movies of their choice by searching for its name in the website.
 
## Design Process

This website is mainly just for people who either want to learn more above specific movies by searchinf for their information, or if they want to see what upcoming or popular movies they can watch. If a user wants to search for the information for a specific movie, they will be able to easily do it by inputting the name of the movie on the search bar at the top of the site inside of navigation panel. As for the new and top rated movies, they will simply just select the respective options, which is also on the navigation panel. Doing this will display the movie posters on the screen, which the user can then click on to bring them to the movie information page where they will be able to read up about more information about the movie that they have selected, such as the genre, the releas date, and the ratings of the movie.

This site will be the best way for people who need it as it is very user friendly, only needing a single click most of the time for them to access the movies that they are looking for, or in the case of the search bar, just to type in the full or partial name of a movie in order to find it. The information about each movie is also neatly displayed in a single page for the user to easily read from, and requires no further input as everything will be shown on the same page. Overall, this site is extremely easy to use and the people who are in need of the website's functions will easily get the information they need from it in almost no time at all.
